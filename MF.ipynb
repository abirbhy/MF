        "2) The final list of short-listed risk factors are included in the scorecard\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "4) Usually, the analyst scores each factor (out of the maximum possible score) based on documented criteria or his/her perception of risk. However, to maintain objectivity, audit trail, and uniformity across scores, it is best practice to have closed-ended possible options for each factor. Each option has its respective numerical points. The score assigned to a factor will then be equal to an option’s points as applicable\r\n",
